							<p>I was born and raised in this community. I grew up biking the Monon, serving pizza slices at Bazbeaux's, and representing North Central high school as both a diver and captain of the varsity softball team. After following my initial dream of pursuing a career in Sport Management I attended Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida. I realized there's truly nothing like the Midwest and came back home. Initially I worked for Northwestern Mutual as a Financial Advisor, and while working in the corporate world provided me with great experience, it didn't give me the satisfaction I wanted out a career. I wanted to wake up and be excited to go to work!</p>

							<p>After some soul searching and talking things over with my family, I decided to partner with my mother in real estate and our partnership was formed. We're third and fourth generation realtors who not only bring a wealth of experience, but also a passion, to the process of buying and selling homes. I understand that buying a home is a huge deal. The process can seem daunting, but like any former athlete, I'm not intimidated by challenges; I'm inspired by them.</p>

							<p>I'm passionate about the strong sense of community Indianapolis has to offer, and have loved watching my hometown grow into a nationally recognized city. I work to share that passion with buyers, helping them navigate the different neighborhoods and vibrant cultural districts have to offer. When I'm off the clock, if you can truly call that, you can always find me exploring my city with my high school sweetheart turned husband and out children Leah, Dottie and James. It seems like everyday there's something new going on in Indy, be it a restaurant opening, new microbrew debut, or a cultural festival. I'm an active person and a go getter. I've heard people say there isn't much to do in Indy, I'm here to prove to those people that if you're bored, you're boring. Let me help you find all this great city has to offer and help you make it feel like home.</p>

								<p>My wife and I truly enjoyed working with Ellie and Janet throughout our first home buying experience. By explaining the ins and outs of buying a house, keeping us up-to-date on new listings that matched our criteria, and being readily available to see houses around our busy work schedules, they both were outstanding! They turned a stressful process into an enjoyable experience that ended with us getting our favorite house. Without hesitation, we would recommend The Clark Group to any friends or family that are looking for a new home in the Indy area!</p>

								<p>My fiance and I were moving to Indy from Chicago, and Ellie was tasked with helping us find the perfect first house. The kicker was that my fiance would not be in town to view any of the showings in person. Ellie and I went out to a number of houses over a few weeks, and what I appreciated most about Ellie was her honest opinion about each house. She knew what was important to my fiance, and never let me settle just because I was tired of looking. It was never about trying to sell us a place, it was always about finding us the perfect first home. After many showings, we found that perfect home and I can't thank Ellie enough for her help in the process. I relied on her from the very beginning aspects of the search until the closing, and she made the process easy and stress-free the entire way. I would absolutely recommend The Clark Group to anyone and everyone looking for a home!</p>

								<p>I would highly recommend The Clark Group to help you find your dream home! We worked with Ellie Clark Orzeske and have recommended her to all our family and friends! She was outstanding to work with. She was always available for questions, showings, and was so patient and helpful throughout the whole home buying process! She made the whole process enjoyable and stress free. We are so glad we worked with her and found our dream home to start our family. Thank you Ellie and The Clark Group!</p>

								<p>I have known Ellie for a bit and spoke to her about a year ago that I might start looking at homes. Through the beginning of my search, I reached out to Ellie to find a home that fits my search criteria. Alas, this last week I closed on an awesome home in Fountain Square! Throughout the buying and closing process, she has been beyond pleasant to work with! She has been responsive and sometimes I joke and tell her it's ok not to respond to me right away, but she does. It's her attentiveness to my concerns and honesty regarding the house that has made this business relationship so great. Her expertise in client relations and understanding what you are looking for in a house are terrific. I would highly recommend The Clark Group next time you are searching for a house or selling. They have been absolutely great!</p>
